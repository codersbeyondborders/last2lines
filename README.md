# ✨ Last2Lines

> **Voices that Matter, Lines that Unite.**  
> A digital campaign platform that turns poetry into peaceful protest.

## 📖 About the Project
Last2Lines is a **web app for digital social campaigns using poetry**.  
Instead of likes or fleeting tweets, people around the world contribute **two lines of verse** on social themes — from climate action to women’s empowerment.  

AI moderation refines and ensures safety, then stitches these couplets into a **collective global poem**.

## 🚀 Inspiration
We wanted to transform **art into activism**. Inspired by regions where protests aren’t always safe or accessible, Last2Lines uses poetry as a creative, inclusive form of peaceful protest.  
Every two lines contribute to a movement bigger than one voice.
